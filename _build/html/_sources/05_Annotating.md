# Annotating Bursts in EEGs using EDFbrowser


### Step-by-Step Example of Annotating Bursts in an EEG
After loading the EEG data and the montages, follow the next steps to add, edit, delete and save any annotations to the file.

> 1. Start the annotation editor click Window -> Annotation editor
> 2. Create a new annotation by writing the description (e.g. "Burst") of the annotation in the *Description:* box
```{Note}
The onset and the duration of a annotation must be manually entered.  Additionally 'crosshairs' can be utilized to make a more precise measurement of the annotation.    
```
> 3. Use 'crosshairs' to set the start and end of annotations.  
There are two ways to activate the crosshairs:
    >> - Left-click on the channel of interest, from the    pop-up menu select *Crosshair*. \
    or
    >> - Use the short key by pressing Alt+Shift+C ; the crosshairs can be moved by simply dragging and dropping the crosshair to the desired position. \
    Lastly a second crosshair can be activated by the same steps as before.  The second crosshair will provide a difference (delta) in time from the first crosshair.

> 4. With the crosshairs set to the desired 'start' and 'end' times and description filled out click the *Create* button to enter the annotation.

```{Tip}
While labelling burst one can leave the Description text filled in and the double crosshairs visisble, scroll through the EEG (changing only duration onset) to make the Burst labelling faster
```

> 5. To save the annotations simply go to File -> Save -> Save in folder of desired location.  It is recommended that the EEG file being annotated be renamed (e.g. PAT001_annotated).  In that way the original file without annotations is kept, and a sperate annotated file is produced.
