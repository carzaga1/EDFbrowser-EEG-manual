# Rules for Burst Annotation

- Burst-suppression (BS) electroencephalography (EEG) patterns are characterized by alternating periods of high (burst) and low (suppression) amplitude electrical 
  activity in the brain. They have long been observed in the human brain from epilepsy to acute brain injuries such as trauma, early infantile encephalopathy, stroke and
  cardiac arrest [(Shanker et al., 2021)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.673529/full).
- Criteria for Identifying Bursts
  - High-Voltage Slow or Sharp Waves
  - Suppression Phases Before and After Bursts
  - Duration of Suppressed Phases (At least 2.5 seconds)
  - Distinguishing Artifacts from Bursts
